    <p>I am a Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, also supported by an EPSRC Open Fellowship. From 2022 to 2023 I was a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow at the University of Leeds. From 2019 to 2022 I was a senior research associate at the University of East Anglia. From 2017 to 2019 I was a postdoctoral associate at Carnegie Mellon University and concurrently a junior researcher at the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia. I did my PhD (DPhil) at the University of Oxford from 2013 to 2017 under the supervision of Boris Zilber and Jonathan Pila. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from Yerevan State University in 2013 where my undergraduate dissertation was supervised by Yuri Movsisyan.</p>
